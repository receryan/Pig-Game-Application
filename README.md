# Pig-Game-Application
Two player browser-based game built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

This application was developed interactively with online instructor Jonas Schmedtmann through his course "The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Hero" on Udemy. The application is used to teach some important concepts regarding the inplementation of JavaScript functionality to HTML/CSS documents, the adding and altering to these documents to achieve a certain end goal, DOM manipulation, and so on.

This application is a two player, turn-based game in which one player begins by rolling a standard 6-sided dice. After each roll, the number shown by the dice is added a "turn total." Once the dice has been rolled, the player will have the option to lock in their earned points or continue rolling in hopes of growing this point cache. However, if the player rolls a 1, their turn ends, they lose all cached points for that turn, and the next player's turn begins. The game ends when one player reaches 100 points.

*It should be noted that students of the course are given base templates for the application, within which the student will make all appropriate changes and additions. Therefore, to avoid plagiarism, Jonas Schmedtmann is the rightful owner of the HTML and CSS templates used in this project.*
